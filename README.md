**Metropolis** is a high-performance, narrative-driven system monitor built for the terminal. It transcends traditional hardware monitoring by transforming raw kernel metrics into a living, breathing **Cyberpunk Skyline**. 

Every flicker of a neon sign, every shuttle streaking across the sky, and every drop of rain is a direct reflection of your system's heartbeat.

## Features

- **Dynamic Branding**: The central monolith automatically detects your OS (Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu, etc.) and brands itself accordingly.
- **CPU (The Heartbeat)**: High utility triggers "Rush Hour"—flooding sky-lanes with high-speed traffic and increasing pedestrian density.
- **Disk I/O (Logistics)**: Intense activity triggers **Heavy Industrial Shuttles**. Watch long-haulers move "physical data" across the district.
- **RAM (Illumination)**: Memory usage dictates the overall occupancy and glow of the city's monoliths.
- **Neon Signage**: Secondary buildings display your **Top CPU Processes** as vibrant neon signs.
- **Dynamic Pursuits**: Random high-stakes police chases streak across the skyline. Look for the **Red Fugitive** and **Interceptor** units.
- **Procedural Night**: Window patterns and traffic cycles are session-unique.
